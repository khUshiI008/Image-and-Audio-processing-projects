# Image Processing Project using OpenCV

## Description

This project is an image processing application implemented using OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision and image processing library. The application provides various functionalities for manipulating images, performing operations like filtering, transformation, edge detection, and more.

## Features

- Image loading and display.
- Basic image manipulation (e.g., resizing, cropping).
- Filtering techniques (e.g., blurring, sharpening).
- Edge detection algorithms (e.g., Canny edge detection).
- Color space conversions (e.g., RGB to grayscale).
- Saving processed images.

## Installation

1. Install OpenCV. You can install OpenCV using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

   For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-processing
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python image_processing_app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `image_processing_app.py`.
2. Load an image using the provided functionality.
3. Explore various image processing features available in the application's interface.
4. Apply operations like filtering, transformations, or edge detection.
5. Save the processed image if desired.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
